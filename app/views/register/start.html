    <p>There are 2 steps to registering a death:</p>

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Give information about the person and yourself.</li>
        <li>Make an appointment with our registrars to sign paperwork and order death certificates. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can check and change your answers at the interview. If you prefer, you can answer the questions at the interview.</p>

    {% from "govuk/components/inset-text/macro.njk" import govukInsetText %}

    {{ govukInsetText({
        text: "Your appointment should take place within the next 5 days. Contact the registrar at your local council if you need to hold a burial or cremation earlier than this."
    }) }}

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need</h2>

    <p>You cannot save and return to your answers, so it’s a good idea to have all the information before you start.</p>
    <p>You’ll need their:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>full name, and any previous names</li>
        <li>date and place of birth</li>
        <li>place of death</li>
        <li>last address</li>
        <li>occupation, or last occupation if they were retired</li>
        <li>spouse or civil partner's full name, date of birth and occupation
    </ul>
